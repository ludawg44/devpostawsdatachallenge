# DevPost AWS Data Exchange Challenge

## Aiding Small Business With Intelligent Targeting

By Luis Vera

## Inspiration
COVID-19 has changed every business, every industry and every long term business strategy. Retail banking was already battling an aging strategy while furiously building their digital capacity. For those companies that have successfully erected a digital transformation program within their firm, they have yet to build value gathering insight on how to approach new business amidst the pandemic. 

## What it does
This project attempts to analyze data from the Small Business Administration (SBA) Loans provided by Enigma. This analysis will try to optimize targeting for businesses in need of SBA loans. Traditionally, SBA Loans take weeks to get approved. Borrows have looked for online lenders to speed up the process. If banks can target the areas in greatest need of a loan than they can help rebuild this economy faster. 

## How I built it
I currently downloaded Enigma’s SBA Loans (7a and 504) on AWS Data Exchange and moved the files on AWS S3. Then I imported the data into AWS QuickSight and analyzed the datasets. 

## Challenges I ran into
Creating a manifest file is not as intuitive as it seems. I hit a lot of roadblocks that slowed down my ability to analyze the data. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Completing this submission. 

## What I learned
I learned a lot about moving data within AWS Data Exchange and how to easy it was to analyze it in AWS QuickSight. 

## What's next for Aiding Small Business With Intelligent Targeting
I’m going to run the data on AWS SageMaker and find some models to optimize targeting.
